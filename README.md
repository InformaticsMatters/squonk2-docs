# Squonk 2 Documentation
The [Sphinx]-based Squonk 2 documentation.

Building the documentation, from a suitably equipped virtual environment: -

    $ source ~/.venv/squonk2-docs/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r build-requirements.txt

    $ cd docs
    $ make html

You'll find the HTML `index.html` file in `docs/_build/html`.
