What was Squonk before Squonk 2?
================================

We previously created the `Squonk Computational Notebook <https://squonk.it/>`_, a web based
workflow took that was targetted and end user scientists. There are many scientific workflow
tools available, but to our knowledge, all are targetted at programmers, or at least you need
think like a programmer to use them. Jupyter Notebooks, for instance, are fantastic tools, but
you need to write Python code to use them, and normal scientists don't want to have to do that!

What was needed was a simple to use, but powerful workflow tool, and the Squonk Computational Notebook
acheived this to a large extent.

What is Squonk 2?
=================

Squonk 2 is a completely new set of products that broadens the scope of the Squonk Computational
Notebook and addresses one key design flaw that we made, that is to make Squonk 2 *data centric*.
The Squonk Computational Notebook was workflow centric and it was not so simple to create data in one
notebook and then use that data in another notebook. Squonk 2 changes this completely, with data
being at the heart of things. The key component is called the *Data Manager* which rather makes the
point.

Squonk 2 is in the early stage of development and **not** yet ready for real world use.
Access is by invitation only. Send an eamil to info@informaticsmatters.com if you would like to try it
out.

The current focus is on virtual screening workflows, and we already have userful functionality for compound
selection and preparation, protein preparation, docking and rescoring.
